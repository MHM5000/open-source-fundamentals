### What Is Licensing?

A lot of confusion is out there about what exactly licensing means. When you license your work, you’re not giving away any of your rights. You still hold the original copyright (or patent if you have one) on that work. What a license does is grant specific permissions for others to use that work.
Licensing is a great alternative to just releasing your work into the public domain or granting permissions on a case-by-case basis. By releasing into the public domain, you relinquish any copyright, and no one is obligated to list you as the original author or contributor. In the latter case, you may end up spending more time dealing with individual permissions than designing or developing.
Open-source licenses make it easy for others to contribute to a project without having to seek special permission. It also protects you as the original creator, making sure you at least get some credit for your contributions. It also helps to prevent others from claiming your work as their own.

Ok, so let´s say you want to start your own open source project, or open source code you´ve previously written.

Making your code available as open source involves much more than just indicating on the project web page that the code is licensed under a particular open source licence. Not only do you need to provide a way for people to download and/or contribute to the project, but you also need to choose the most appropriate licence and address other legal requirements. One of the most important of these is that you must be able to prove that the code can legally be released under that licence; another is that people who download it must be told what their responsibilities are to the project owner.
