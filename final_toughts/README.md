ThatÂ´s it, now you know how awesome open source is. I wanted to make this book as short as I could, so most people could read it in about 30 minutes or so, but at the same time I wanted to explain the important stuff you have to know about the subject and I think I did well. If you think my book needs to cover more fundamental subjects about open source, if you spot some typos, etc.  please let me know and/or contribute with [the repository]() on GitHub, pull requests are welcome.
