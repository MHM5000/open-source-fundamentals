# Final toughts

ThatÂ´s it, now you know how awesome open source is. I wanted to make this book as short as I could so most people could read it in about 30 minutes or so, but at the same time I wanted to explain the important stuff you have to know about the subject and I think I did well. If you think my book needs to cover more fundamental subjects about open source, if you spot some typos, etc.  please let me know and/or contribute with [the repository](www.github.com/diegowifi/open-source-fundamentals) on GitHub, pull requests are welcome.

If you liked what I wrote, learned something new feel and want to tell me what you think feel free to send me a [tweet](http://www.twitter.com/Diego_WiFi), also, all donations are very welcome, this motivates me to write more Gitbooks with more cool content, and of course, **free** your you all.

Have fun with your code, thank you.
